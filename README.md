# Code Jam 3

In a survery we recently conducted, we asked what theme people wanted to see for this code jam. The most popular option,
with 26/115 votes, was **The world ends in 10 minutes**. Thus, the task for this code jam involves creating a game under that theme.

This task is a little more freeform than the other code jams we've had so far - we're happy to accept games in any form,
_as long as they fit that theme._ You may use PyGame, Kivy, Curses/Unicurses, Pyxel, web frameworks like Flask, or anything else
your team desires. **Please provide instructions on how to set up and run your game within the README where necessary**.

Remember that teamwork is paramount - You _will need to work together_. For this jam, we've assigned a leader for each team
based on their responses to the application form. Remember to listen to your leader, and communicate with the rest of your team!

# Tips

-   Please lint your code, and listen to the linter. We recommend **flake8**, and you can use `pipenv run lint` to run it.
-   Remember to work closely with the rest of your team.
-   We're not expecting the next Assassins Creed or God of War. Don't get too ambitious and overstretch yourselves -
    it's much better to have a finished project.
-   Remember to fill out the **Project Information** section below.
-   If you haven't used Git before or have other questions about the task or code jam, we recommend reading
    [the Code Jam section on our wiki](https://wiki.pythondiscord.com/wiki/jams).

# Setting Up

As usual, you should be using [Pipenv](https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Take a look
[at the documentation](https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) if you've never used it before. In short:

-   Setting up for development: `pipenv install --dev`
-   Running the application (assuming you use our project layout): `pipenv run start`

# Project Information

disasters

pipenv run start or python -m project
To run the editor: pipenv run editor or python -m project --editor
